# LaPlace 
 A matrix determinant calculator by LaPlace's method

 Even though there are many other easier ways to get to the determinant of a matrix, LaPlace's method is the nicest one.

 Since, by this method, in cofactor's formula minors are included, each minor gets a matrix of order: **initial_order - 1**. This means that it becomes a huge ramification, specially when the order of the matrix is big.

 This project has 2 files: one has an integrated interface, the other don't.

 The interface was not supposed to be beautiful or really useful, just an addition to make this project a little more visible and out of the boring terminal. That's why not much effort was put doing this GUI.

 This project was made for learning purposes.
